# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
Possible tools:
- Regula: https://github.com/fugue/regula
- Chef Inspect: https://github.com/inspec/inspec
- Terrascan: https://github.com/accurics/terrascan

### Example vulnerability
It can identify SSH with password enabled, s3 buckets without any restriction, and much more. Examples:
Regula: IAM policies with full "*:*" administrative privileges
Chef Inspect: Should have MFA enabled
Terrascan : Ingress open to 0.0.0.0/0

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Possible tools:
- Clair: https://github.com/quay/clair
- Anchore: https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine
- Trivy: https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy

### Example vulnerability
It can be identified out-of-date image versions, missing Patches, and common vulnerabilities. Examples:
- Clair: Read/write access of root/.rhosts only by root
- Anchore:
    Image id: 1d310298312903812938021
    Repo Tag: docker.io/worpress:latest
    Trigger id: CVE-2017-14062+libdin11
    Gate: vulnerabilities
    Check output: HIGH vulnerability found in os package type (dpkg) - libdin11 (CVE-2017-14062 - htts://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14062)
- Trivy: 
    Library: curl
    vulnerability Id: CVE-2018-14618
    Severity: CRITICAL

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
Possible tools: AWS Config, AWS Inspector and AWS GuardDuty;

### Example vulnerability
It can identify roles with unecessary permissions and possible vulnerabilities; Over permission for instances; Lack of MFA for the users;
- AWS Config: s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only - Checks whether S3 buckets have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL). The rule is COMPLIANT if buckets explicitly deny access to HTTP requests. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if bucket policies allow HTTPS requests.
- AWS Inspector: On instance i-02fa9d1d7aedd58ac, UDP port 22 which is associated with 'LDAP' is reachable from the internet
- AWS GuardDuty: UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce : Instance: i-096fe001a4bdf5d9b - 54.36.165.34 is performing SSH brute force attacks against i-096fe001a4bdf5d9b. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password
