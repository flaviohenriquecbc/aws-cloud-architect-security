# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Create a white list of IPs that can have access with SSH or allow only using Session Manager.
2. Don't allow SSH with password. Disable it.
3. Allow SSH only for users with specific roles or using using Session Manager.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. Limit the buckets that can be accessed, instead of using wildcard selector, allow access just for the buckets needed. 
2. Enable server side encryption for the buckets;
3. Limit the instances that can access the content of the buckets.
