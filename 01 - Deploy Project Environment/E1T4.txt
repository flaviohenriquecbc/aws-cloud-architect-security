Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The following inboud rules are set to the Web Application (Security group: WebAppSG), but they are unecessary:
- Inbound: TCP on port 80
- Inbound: All traffic in all ports
- Inboud: SSH on port 22
Since we don't need any of these inbound rules, we could delete them and work with the Least Priviledge access. Also limit access to this application, just by the load balancer inside this subnet.

Also, we can limit the outbound to just port 80:
- Outbound: TCP on port 80.
Other ports are not necessary to be set on this security group.

# Poor practice 2
S3 buckets don't have any specific permission (ACL) to restrict who perform any action on them. At the moment, is possible to the bucket owner only to read/edit/delete/create items on the bucket and itself. We can limit the buckets and provide specific ACLs to those who can access the data, upload and manage it.

Also, the buckets are configured to being accessed from outside the VPC, should be limited only internally.

# Poor practice 3
InstanceRolePolicy-C3 we could limit the rule to just he created buckes and not all of them. We can use Least Priviledge access.
